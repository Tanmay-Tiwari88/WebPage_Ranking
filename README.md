## Area of Information Retrieval
It is an implementation of Google's PageRank algorithm. It allows a user to search for a term on the https://www.clemson.edu/ domain and see every webpage that the word appears on along with that page's Google PageRank score (which shows how important the webpage is).

## Dataset Description
https://www.clemson.edu/ domain

## Platform to be used

C++ Programming language on Visual Studio Code platform. 
Github.
